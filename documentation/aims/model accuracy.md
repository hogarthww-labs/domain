 # Model accuracy
 
 > A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness. — Alfred Korzybski, Science and Sanity, p. 58.

Solving a problem in the code involves modelling that problem in the code. Developers often do this poorly as they rarely have deep domain knowledge of the problem being solved and they bake into their models concerns stemming from the technology they are working in.

   > "The goal of domain-driven design is to create better software by focusing on a model of the domain rather than technology.", Eric Evans, Domain Driven Design p148.

    > "fundamentally, DDD is the principle that we should be focusing on the deep issues of the domain our users are engaged in, that the best part of our minds should be devoted to understanding that domain, and collaborating with experts in that domain to wrestle it into a conceptual form that we can use to build powerful, flexible software." Eric Evans

To make more accurate models, developers can turn to domain experts. Domain experts are people who already know how to accurately model the problem as they are people with significant experience in the domain. They know the concepts and language that are important in that domain. The more aligned developers are with domain experts the more they can utilise the domain experts existing modelling skills. This allows them to develop models of the problem that more accuractly reflect the problem as it actually is in real life. It also helps with the communication between the domain experts and the developers. They communicate better because everyone is speaking the same language.

Model accuracy is fundamental to writing code that solves the right problem and to being able to find the right expectations that should be verified in your code.

A goal of this project is have generators that allow you to easily implement design patterns that allow you to express the domain in code.
