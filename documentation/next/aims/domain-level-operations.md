# Domain level operations

The libraries that will be generated by this project will include the grouping folders in their scope, module and classes. If these grouping folders are renamed or should be removed, which can be common, it would be useful to be able to update all of the libraries in the domain using a generator instead of having to update each one individually. An example generator might be to remove a domain which would remove all of the libraries inside a domain. 

The generators for the domain level operations should be technolgy agnostic. That is, they should be able to apply to any domain regardless of the language it is for.
